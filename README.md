# React Native AnalogClock

##### React native analog clock as a nice alternative to traditional timepicker.

This component is a bridge over `native`  [BEMAnalogClock](https://github.com/Boris-Em/BEMAnalogClock)
- Adjust the time on the clock via touch (or disable it)
- customizable
- native behind (*JS thread will thank you later *:smile:)

> NOTE: Swift bridge version

*__IMPORTANT__* : Work in progress (*at early stage*), stay tuned!

## Getting started
